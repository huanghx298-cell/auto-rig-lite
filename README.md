# Lightweight auto rig tool for Maya (FK/IK biped).

A lightweight auto rigging tool for Maya, focused on automated biped setup.
This project provides FK/IK controls and IK–FK blending, without aiming for
full production coverage.

This is a proof-of-concept tool, not a production-ready auto rig system.
